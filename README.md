This is the Project 4 for the Data Comm. The main task is to implement the Internet Packet Analyer.

The syntax is as following:

1. type "make" to compile the program
2. ./analyzer dumpfile -c lines_number //print the summary for the first lines_number lines;
3. ./analyzer dumpfile -v // verbose mode
4. ./analyzer dumpfile -V // print out the details of the packet header.
